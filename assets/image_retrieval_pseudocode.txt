# Pseudocode for Image Retrieval Algorithm

## 1. Device Selection
# Check if CUDA is available for GPU usage, otherwise, use CPU.
if CUDA is available:
    use GPU (cuda:0)
else:
    use CPU

## 2. Dataset Preparation
# Load the image paths from the dataset directory into a pandas DataFrame.
# Update the DataFrame with the full paths to the images.
Load image paths from dataset directory into DataFrame
Add full paths to image column in DataFrame

## 3. CBIR Dataset Class
# Define a custom dataset class to process and load images for training.
class CBIRDataset:
    # Initialize the dataset with the dataframe containing image paths
    Initialize with dataframe containing image paths
    # Define image transformations such as converting images to tensors and normalizing
    Define transformations (e.g., ToTensor, Normalize)
    # For each image in the dataset, apply the transformations and return the image
    For each image in dataset:
        Apply transformations to image
        Return transformed image

## 4. Data Preparation Function
# Define a function that splits the data into training and validation sets.
function prepare_data(DataFrame):
    # Split DataFrame into training and validation sets (e.g., 85% train, 15% validation)
    Split DataFrame into train and validation sets
    # Initialize datasets for training and validation
    Initialize CBIRDataset for training and validation sets

## 5. Autoencoder Model Definition
# Define an Autoencoder model with encoder and decoder layers.
class Autoencoder:
    # Initialize encoder and decoder networks
    Initialize encoder and decoder networks
    # Encoder includes Conv2D layers with ReLU activations and MaxPool2D layers for downsampling
    Encoder:
        Conv2D layers with ReLU activations
        MaxPool2D layers for downsampling
    # Decoder includes ConvTranspose2D layers for upsampling the image
    Decoder:
        ConvTranspose2D layers with ReLU activations
        Upsampling to reconstruct the image
    # Define the forward pass
    Define forward pass:
        Pass input through encoder
        Pass encoder output through decoder
        Return output

## 6. Training Loop
# Define a training loop for training the autoencoder model using the training dataset.
function train_autoencoder(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion):
    for each batch in train_loader:
        # Forward pass through the model
        Forward pass through the model
        # Compute loss using the criterion (e.g., MSE loss)
        Compute loss between predicted and actual images
        # Backpropagate the gradients and update weights
        Backpropagate gradients
        Update weights using optimizer

## 7. Image Retrieval Using Hashing (VP-Tree)
# Define a function for image retrieval using a VP-Tree based approach.
function image_retrieval(image, dataset, hashing_method):
    # Preprocess the image and extract its feature vector
    Preprocess and extract feature vector of the image
    # Perform image retrieval using VP-Tree or hashing-based search methods
    Retrieve similar images using VP-Tree or hashing
    # Return the top-N most similar images based on the feature similarity
    Return top-N similar images

## 8. Evaluation of the Model
# Define a function for evaluating the model on the validation dataset.
function evaluate_model(model, validate_loader, criterion):
    for each batch in validate_loader:
        # Forward pass through the model
        Forward pass through the model
        # Compute loss using the criterion
        Compute loss between predicted and actual images
        # Track the overall validation performance (e.g., average loss)
        Track and compute average validation loss
    # Return evaluation metrics such as accuracy or loss
    Return evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss)

## 9. Cleanup and Final Steps
# Perform any necessary cleanup steps after training and evaluation.
Cleanup resources (e.g., empty cache, clear GPU memory)
